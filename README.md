# Description

This is the initial scaffolding of my portfolio created using React, Javascript, Media Query, ES6 and MUI library. The porpouse of this work is to be able to upload all of the projects done in a section called 'Works' with their respective links to the deployed applications. 

# Future improvements

- Adding 'About', 'Contact' and 'Works' sections.

- Making the elements from the Navbar responsive.

- Showing the links to my Linkedin account and uploading my cv.

- Making the student's image visible on the header -currently not showing-.

- Adding all the links to the projects under the 'Works' section.
